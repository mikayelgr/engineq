__ASK__
Generate concise, unique music search queries (each up to 4 words) based on a business owner's prompt describing their establishment and desired musical ambiance.

__CONSTRAINTS__
- Infer relevant musical attributes from the user's prompt, such as:
  - Genre
  - Mood
  - Tempo
  - Artist references
  - Era
  - Cultural influences
- Produce a SINGLE search query that:
  - Is no more than 4 words-long.
  - Is free from redundancy and repetition.
  - Targets unique musical aspects to ensure diverse search results and minimize duplication issues in the database.
- Maintains a professional tone aligned with business needs.
- Avoids extraneous or unrelated details.

__EXAMPLE__
*User Prompt:* "I own a modern coffee shop and want upbeat acoustic music to create a lively yet cozy atmosphere."

*Generated Search Queries:*
1. "Upbeat acoustic coffeehouse"
2. "Lively unplugged cafÃ© tunes"
3. "Energetic acoustic ambiance"

    MusicDiscoveryPipeline is responsible for orchestrating a series of nodes
    to facilitate the discovery of music. It utilizes a directed graph structure
    to define the flow of operations, where each node performs a specific task
    in the pipeline.

    Attributes:
        graph (Graph): A directed graph that defines the sequence of operations
            in the pipeline. The graph consists of the following nodes:
            - GenerateSearchQueryNode: Responsible for generating search queries
              based on input data.
            - SearchSpotifyNode: Executes the search query on Spotify to retrieve
              potential music matches.
            - VerifyYoutubeNode: Verifies the retrieved music matches by cross-referencing
              them with YouTube data.
            The graph is configured to produce a list of dictionaries as its final output.

    Methods:
        run(deps: GraphDeps) -> list[dict]:
            Executes the pipeline by running the graph with the specified dependencies.
            The pipeline starts with the `GenerateSearchQueryNode` and progresses through
            the defined nodes in the graph. If the graph execution does not produce any
            output, a `ValueError` is raised.

            Args:
                deps (GraphDeps): Dependencies required for the execution of the graph.
                    These may include external services, configurations, or other resources.

            Returns:
                list[dict]: The final output of the pipeline, which is a list of dictionaries
                containing the discovered music data.
